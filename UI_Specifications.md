# Corisio — UI Specification

> **Scope:** This document defines every screen, component, state, and interaction for all three Corisio interfaces: the **Public Discovery App**, the **Store Owner App**, and the **Admin Panel**. It is written directly from the backend API behaviour — every field, every validation rule, every status, and every permission is derived from the actual code.

## 1. System Overview

Corisio is a local store directory for Abuja, Nigeria. It is not an e-commerce platform — there is no cart, checkout, payment, or delivery. The product is discovery: users find nearby verified stores and see what those stores stock.

### Three Interfaces

| Interface | Users | Auth Method |
|---|---|---|
| Public Discovery App | General public / customers | No login required |
| Store Owner App | Store owners | Phone number + OTP (JWT) |
| Admin Panel | Corisio staff | Email + password (JWT) |

### Onboarding Status Flow

A store moves through these statuses in order:

```
registered → phone_verified → profile_complete → verified
                                               ↘ rejected
```

Only `verified` stores appear in public search results. This status transition is the core gating mechanism in the entire system.

### Boost Levels

Boosts are earned by referring verified stores. They affect search ranking — not pricing or features.

| Level | Referrals Required | Duration | Ranking Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bronze | 1 validated | 30 days | 1 |
| Silver | 4 validated | 60 days | 2 |
| Gold | 10 validated | 90 days | 3 |
| None | — | — | 0 |

An expired boost is treated as `none`. The boost badge should not appear if `boost.expiresAt` is in the past.

### Ranking Formula

Public store results are ranked by:

```
finalScore = (0.50 × boostScore) + (0.40 × distanceScore) + (0.10 × recencyScore)
```

Featured stores (admin-flagged `isFeatured: true`) receive a 1.25× multiplier on top.

---

## 2. Public Discovery App

This interface requires zero authentication. It is a read-only experience for users discovering stores and products near them.

---

### 2.1 Home / Store Discovery Screen

**Purpose:** The primary entry point. Displays nearby verified stores ranked by boost + distance.

**Data source:** `GET /api/v1/public/stores?lat=&lng=&radius=&...`

**Requirements:**
- On load, prompt for device location permission. If granted, use GPS coordinates as `lat`/`lng`.
- If location is denied, show a manual LGA selector (Wuse, Maitama, Garki, Gwarinpa, etc.) and derive approximate coordinates from that.
- Default search radius: 5 km. Allow user to expand to 10, 20, or 50 km.
- Results are paginated (20 per page). Implement infinite scroll or a "Load more" button.

**Store card — fields to show:**
- Store name (`storeName`)
- Category name and icon (`category.name`, `category.icon`)
- LGA (`address.lga`)
- Distance from user in km (`distanceKm`) — only show if GPS was granted
- Boost badge: show a coloured badge if `boost` is non-null. Gold = yellow, Silver = grey, Bronze = orange. Never show an expired boost.
- Store photo: first item from `photos[]`. Show a placeholder image if empty.
- `isFeatured` flag: if true, show a "Featured" label on the card.

**Filter bar (above results):**
- Category dropdown — populated from a static or fetched list of categories
- Sort toggle: Nearest / Top Rated (maps to `sortBy=distance` or `sortBy=boost`)
- Boosted Only toggle (maps to `boostedOnly=true`)

**Search bar:**
- Full-text search on store name. Passes `search=` param. Debounce by 400ms.
- Keep results live as the user types.

**Empty state:**
- "No stores found in your area" with a button to expand radius or clear filters.

**Error state:**
- Location permission denied with no manual LGA selected: show a prompt to select area before searching.

**Engagement tracking (fire-and-forget, no loading state):**
- When a store card appears in the visible viewport: call `POST /public/stores/:id/listing-click` once per session per store.

| `verification_agent` | ✅ (verify/reject only) | View only | View only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `analyst` | View only | View only | View only | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## 5. Shared Design Principles

These rules apply to all three interfaces.

### 5.1 Status Badges

Use consistent colours everywhere:

| Status / Level | Colour |
|---|---|
| verified / active / in_stock | Green |
| profile_complete / pending | Amber / Yellow |
| rejected / inactive / out_of_stock | Red |
| phone_verified / on_order | Blue |
| registered | Grey |
| Gold boost | #F5A623 (orange-gold) |
| Silver boost | #9B9B9B (silver-grey) |
| Bronze boost | #D4622A (bronze-orange) |
| No boost | Not shown |

### 5.2 Currency Formatting

All prices are in Nigerian Naira (NGN). Format as: `₦1,500` (no decimal places). The currency field in the API defaults to `NGN` and is reserved for future multi-currency support — the UI should read it but always display the ₦ symbol for now.

### 5.3 Token Handling

- Access token expires in 7 days. Refresh token expires in 30 days.
- When any API call returns 401, attempt a silent token refresh using `POST /stores/auth/refresh-token` (or `/corisio/admin/auth/refresh-token` for admin).
- If refresh also returns 401, clear all stored tokens and navigate to the login screen.
- Never log or expose JWT tokens in error messages or crash reports.

### 5.4 Fire-and-Forget Engagement Calls

The following API calls should be made without awaiting a response and without showing any loading indicator or error state:
- `POST /public/stores/:id/view`
- `POST /public/stores/:id/listing-click`
- `POST /public/stores/:id/call-click`
- `POST /public/stores/:id/direction-click`

These are analytics events. If they fail, the user experience should be unaffected.

### 5.5 Coordinates

The API stores coordinates in GeoJSON format: `[longitude, latitude]`. When displaying to users, convert to `{lat, lng}` format. When sending coordinates to the API, send as `[lng, lat]`. This conversion must be handled explicitly — swapping these is a common source of bugs.

### 5.6 Search Appearances Increment

The server increments `searchAppearances` on products and stores automatically when they appear in search results. The client does not need to call any endpoint for this — it happens server-side as a fire-and-forget write during the search query.

### 5.7 Soft Deletes

Products are never hard-deleted. When a store owner "deletes" a product, it sets `isActive: false`. The product remains in the database for analytics. In the admin product list, allow filtering by `isActive` to see both active and inactive products.

### 5.8 Pagination

All list endpoints return pagination metadata:
```json
{
  "total": 47,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "totalPages": 3,
  "hasNextPage": true,
  "hasPrevPage": false
}
```

Use `hasNextPage` to determine whether to show a "Load more" button or enable infinite scroll. Never calculate `totalPages` on the client — use the value from the API.

### 5.9 Empty vs. No-Access States

Distinguish clearly between:
- **Empty state:** The resource exists but has no items yet → friendly illustration + CTA
- **No-access state:** The user's role/status does not permit this action → locked state with explanation
- **Not found:** The resource doesn't exist → 404 screen

### 5.10 Accessibility and Localisation

- All prices, times, and dates should use the Nigerian locale (English, West Africa Time UTC+1)
- Phone numbers are Nigerian (+234 format)
- LGA names in dropdowns should be spelled exactly as stored in the database
- Right-to-left (RTL) is not required at this stage
- Minimum touch target size: 44×44pt for all interactive elements
